TODO:
Main: read the entire file. send the text to the parser.

Parser: Read the text line by line. verify correctness with syntax rules (using regex). build an array of line objects.

Executer: gets the array of line objects. execute line by line.
need to add elements of interpreter, for example: an array of the program variables (look at code context).

CodeContext: To make the design better we need the line.run() to have a context.
the context would be everything that the program needs:
	- array of variables and their values
	- next line to run
	- more stuff we come up with
So basically in the executer class we would see something like:
	while(...)
		line = getNextLine(codeContext); //codeContext knows what is the next line
		line.run(codeContext);
